## Placeholder Convention

```
{project_root}   = root directory of the active project (walk up from cwd)
{knowledge_root} resolves in order:
  1. {project_root}/.unified-memory/knowledge/          ← per-project (checked first)
  2. {project_root}/ai-agent/skills/ai-dlc/knowledge/   ← skills in project repo (use in company)
  3. ~/.claude/skills/ai-dlc/knowledge/                  ← user-level global fallback

{skills_root}    = {project_root}/skills/
{cwd}            = current working directory
```

> Note: `{project}` without `_root` is reserved for project **name** display only (e.g. "load memory for {project}").
> All path placeholders must use `{project_root}`.
