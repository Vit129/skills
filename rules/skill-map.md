# Skill Map

> Canonical inventory is `~/.claude/skills/`.
> All paths are relative to `{skills_root}/` (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/`).
> For any dev/QA coding task → start with `governance/aidlc/` first.
> Keywords are semantic — match by meaning, not exact string.
> Bilingual triggers (TH/EN) are in each SKILL.md description.

## Quick Commands (`~/.claude/commands/`)

| Command | Route to | What it does |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `/spec` | `governance/aidlc/` Phase 0→1 | Define requirements, inception, DECISIONS file |
| `/plan` | `governance/aidlc/` Phase 2 | Break spec into tasks (qa-task-design / dev-task-design) |
| `/build` | `governance/aidlc/` Phase 3 | Implement tasks one by one, commit each |
| `/test` | `qa/playwright-testing/` + `debugging/debug-mantra/` | Write/run tests, triage failures |
| `/review` | `review/review-personas/` | Pre-merge review (code + security + test coverage) |
| `/simplify` | `dev/code-simplification/` | Reduce complexity, preserve behavior |
| `/ship` | `dev/shipping-launch/` | Pre-launch checklist, staged rollout, monitoring |
| `/resume` | Scan `.aidlc/` → find last phase → continue | Pick up where you left off |
| `/skill-review` | `agent-memory/skill-usage.log` + `agent-memory/skill-log.md` | Read usage counts → propose improvements → auto-draft for crystallized skills |

> Commands are shortcuts, NOT bypasses — prerequisites still apply.
