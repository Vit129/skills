# Workflow, Response Format & Citation

Standard behaviors that apply to every task, every agent, every project.

---

## Response Structure

Every non-trivial response MUST follow this order:

1. **Done** — What was just completed (1–3 bullet points, past tense)
2. **Next** — What the user needs to do or decide right now (1–3 items)
3. **Why** — Brief reasoning for the approach taken (1–2 sentences max)
4. **Options** — (Optional) Proposed next steps for the user to pick from

**Example:**
```
Done:
- Created auth middleware with JWT validation
- Added 401 error handling

Next:
- Run: npm test src/auth
- Confirm token expiry (currently 24h — change if needed)

Why: JWT over session cookies avoids server-side state and works cleanly with the existing REST API.

Options:
A) Add refresh token rotation now
B) Ship as-is and revisit in v2
```

## Clarifying Questions Protocol

Before executing any task with ambiguous scope, ask AT MOST 3 targeted questions:

1. What is the expected output/end state?
2. Are there constraints I should know about (tech, time, budget)?
3. Should I propose options or just pick the best approach?

Do NOT start generating output before clarifying questions are answered when scope is unclear.

---

## Quality Self-Assessment

Before delivering any output, internally score it 1–10 on: Correctness, Completeness, Clarity.

If score < 9, list specific improvements and apply them before responding.

---

## Test Before Deliver

For any code output:
- Run the relevant test suite or lint check
- If tests fail → fix before responding
- State test result in **Done** section: `Tests: ✓ 12 passed` or `Tests: ✗ 2 failed (fixed)`

---

## Periodic Self-Review

After completing any task that took more than 3 tool calls, append:

```
Review:
- What worked well:
- What could be improved:
- Suggested next upgrade (with estimated effort):
```

---

## Context Window Health

Trigger `/compact` when:
- Conversation exceeds 50 messages, OR
- Response quality or consistency noticeably degrades

---

## Do

- **Read `project_specs.md` first** before writing any code or plan
- **Ask 3 clarifying questions** when scope is ambiguous
- **Follow Done→Next→Why→Options** structure for every non-trivial reply
- **Run tests after every edit** — fix failures before responding
- **Self-score output to 9/10** — list and apply improvements before delivering
- **Use `/compact`** when context exceeds 80% or response quality degrades
- **Load the relevant skill** from `rules/skill-map.md` before starting domain work
- **Update `agent-memory/memory.md`** after every meaningful decision or task change

## Don't

- Don't write code before clarifying ambiguous requirements
- Don't deliver untested output
- Don't skip phase gates defined in `rules/project-rules.md`
- Don't retry the same failing approach 3+ times — escalate or ask
- Don't add features, comments, or abstractions beyond what the task requires
- Don't let context window fill to 100% before compacting

---

## Context & Style

- **Language:** Thai for user interaction, English for generated files and code
- **Tone:** Direct, evidence-based, no flattery
- **Code comments:** Only when the WHY is non-obvious — never narrate WHAT
- **Commit style:** Describe the why, not the what

---

## Citation Format

```
[from: LESSON-AUTH-001]                      ← lesson
[from: skill:qa/playwright-testing]          ← skill (new paths)
[from: memory:{wing}/{room}]                 ← memory palace
```

## Example Prompts

| Goal | Prompt Pattern |
|------|---------------|
| Start a feature | "I want to build X. Ask me 3 clarifying questions first." |
| Run tests in a loop | "Run tests, auto-fix failures, repeat until all pass, then report." |
| Parallel work | "Spawn subagents: A builds X, B builds Y, C writes tests for both." |
| Create a skill | "I keep doing X — turn this into a reusable skill." |
| Review quality | "Score this output 1–10 and list specific improvements to reach 9/10." |
