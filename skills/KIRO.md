# Kiro Workspace

## Agent Tier (pick before every task)

| Task | Agent |
|------|-------|
| Most tasks — logic, impl, bug fix, tests | Claude Sonnet 4.6 (default) |
| Complex multi-file / async / critical path | Claude Opus 4.6 (escalate only) |

> Escalation rule: if Sonnet fails twice on the same problem → escalate to Opus, don't retry.
> Task is NOT done without: code written + tests pass + commit hash.

## Rules (KIRO-specific)

- **Cache:** Do NOT edit steering mid-session (breaks prompt cache)
- **Branch:** Always `git checkout -b feat/...` before starting work

## Citation format (when answering from knowledge base)

```
[from: LESSON-AUTH-001]        ← lesson
[from: skill:ai-dlc/rules/playwright-rules] ← skill
[from: memory:{wing}/{room}]   ← memory palace
```

<!-- ═══ AGENTS.md — Shared Agent Rules (inlined) ═══ -->

## Reading Order & Trust Priority

When information conflicts, higher items win:

1. Latest explicit user instruction
2. Verified codebase state (grep/read before acting)
3. `AGENTS.md` — shared rules & skill map (inlined in each agent's config file)
4. Agent-specific file — tier routing, escalation, cache rules
5. `agent-memory/palace/state.md` — active session state
5b. `agent-memory/knowledge/index.md` — knowledge index (keyword routing for lessons + articles)
6. Skill files at `{skills_root}/` (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/ai-agent/skills/`, or project `ai-agent/skills/`)
7. After any file write or decision → note internally that session has unsaved work (dirty); before ending session, follow the save workflow in `system/agent-memory/` skill

If notes conflict with the codebase, trust the codebase.

## Skill Map

> All paths relative to `{skills_root}/` (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/` or `ai-agent/skills/`)
> For any dev/QA coding task → start with `ai-dlc/core/aidlc/` first (governance + phase routing)

## Karpathy Principles (always active)

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## Rules (always active)

- **AIDLC first:** All dev/QA work goes through `ai-dlc/core/aidlc/` — never call qa/dev skills directly unless AIDLC routes there
- **AIDLC modes:** Support 3 modes — Full (default), QA Only, Dev Only. See `workflow.md` → "Execution Modes" for phase matrix and routing tables.
  - `"start AI-DLC QA scenario only"` → QA Scenario Only (Lite Inception → 2.1 → 2.2)
  - `"start AI-DLC QA automation"` → QA Automation (Lite Inception → 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.3 → 2.4, then asks: API / Web UI / Android / iOS)
  - `"start AI-DLC Dev only"` → Dev Only (Lite Inception → 2.5 → 3.1 → 3.2 → 3.3)
- **AIDLC mode hard rules:** ALL modes MUST use `.aidlc/` folder + DECISIONS→PLAN→EXECUTE. QA modes MUST NOT skip qa-task-design. Dev mode MUST NOT skip dev-task-design.
- **AIDLC exception — Postman migration:** `postman-to-playwright/postman/` skill bypasses AIDLC entirely — source of truth is the Postman collection, not requirements. Use migration flow in `postman-to-playwright/postman/SKILL.md` directly (Step 1→2→2.5→3→4). No `.aidlc/` folder needed.
- **Phase gates:** If prerequisites missing → STOP, tell user what's needed first
- **Phase gate check (MANDATORY):** Before ANY dev/QA work → scan `.aidlc/[system]/[feature]/` for existing outputs → find first missing phase → start THERE, not at the user's requested phase. If no `.aidlc/` folder exists for the feature → start from Phase 0/1.2 (Full mode) or Lite Inception (QA/Dev Only mode). NEVER skip to a later phase. This check MUST happen BEFORE reading spec docs or generating any output.
- **No shortcuts:** "เขียน code เลย" without prerequisites = STOP, not proceed
- **Knowledge check:** Before writing test code, check `ai-dlc/knowledge/` for existing templates + lessons
- **Language:** English for all generated files, Thai for user interaction
- **Test:** After every edit → run matching test (mapping: `rules/test-coverage.md`)
- **Build:** Build must pass + commit hash required before task is done
- **Playwright:** no `waitForTimeout()` · `getByTestId` > `getByRole` · AAA pattern
- **Escalate:** Don't retry the same failing approach 3+ times — hand off or ask

## Do Not Store

Never record: secrets/credentials, raw chat transcripts, chain-of-thought reasoning, speculative notes without evidence, duplicate summaries already in `agent-memory/`.

## Minimum Update Contract

After meaningful work, update:

- `agent-memory/palace/state.md` → Current Focus + Open Threads when focus/blockers/next steps change
- `agent-memory/knowledge/index.md` + `knowledge/evolution.md` → every dirty save (mandatory Knowledge Sync Gate)
- `agent-memory/` rooms → when decisions, architecture choices, or lessons are made
- Trigger "save session + learn" at session end if dirty=true
