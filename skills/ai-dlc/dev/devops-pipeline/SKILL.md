# DevOps Pipeline

Create CI/CD pipelines and manage pull requests across Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI.

## When to Load Each Reference

| User says | Load |
|-----------|------|
| "create pipeline", "CI/CD YAML", "schedule tests", "cron" | `references/pipeline.md` |
| "create PR", "pull request", "link work items", "test summary" | `references/pull-request.md` |
| "sync to DevOps", "create work items", "create tasks via MCP" | `references/azure-sync.md` |
| "GitHub Actions", "workflow YAML", "GitHub CI", "branch protection" | `references/github-actions.md` |
| "commit", "push", "git commit", "คอมมิต", "พุช" | `references/git-commit.md` |
| "scan image", "Trivy", "CodeQL", "Gitleaks", "SAST", "SCA", "secret scan", "security gate" | `references/security-scanning.md` |

Ask which platform if not stated, then follow the appropriate reference:

- Azure DevOps → `azure-sync.md` for work items + `pipeline.md` for YAML
- GitHub → `github-actions.md` for workflow YAML + `pull-request.md` for PRs
- GitLab CI → follow GitHub Actions patterns but adapt syntax to `.gitlab-ci.yml` (stages, jobs, artifacts)

- **Pipeline** — Generate pipeline YAML files with scheduling, test commands, and notifications. (Read `references/pipeline.md`)
- **Pull Request** — Create PRs linked to work items with test result summaries. (Read `references/pull-request.md`)
- **Azure DevOps Sync** — Auto-create work items, tasks, and test cases via MCP. (Read `references/azure-sync.md`)
- **GitHub Actions** — Workflow YAML for GitHub repositories: triggers, jobs, OIDC keyless auth, reusable workflows, concurrency control, and branch protection. (Read `references/github-actions.md`)
- **Security Scanning** — Shift-left DevSecOps: Trivy (image/deps), CodeQL (SAST), Gitleaks (secrets), Semgrep. Used by both dev and QA pipelines. (Read `references/security-scanning.md`)

## Inline Process

1. **Identify the task** — Determine: Pipeline YAML creation, PR creation, Git commit/push, Azure DevOps sync, or Security scanning. Ask which platform (Azure DevOps / GitHub / GitLab) if not stated.
2. **Pipeline creation** — Ask: trigger type, branch, schedule time (convert to UTC cron), test command. Auto-detect: path, feature name, DB strategy, variable groups. Include test stage (non-negotiable) + security scanning.
3. **Git commit & push** — Format: `[AB#xxxxx] Description` (direct) or `[PR][AB#xxxxx] Description` (feature branch). Stage specific files, not `git add .`. Never force push without permission.
4. **Create PR** — Prerequisites: all tests must pass (0 failures). Link to work items. Update work item status. FORBIDDEN to create PR with failing tests.
5. **Security scanning** — Enable Trivy, CodeQL, Gitleaks in pipeline. Never disable "temporarily".
6. **Verify** — Pipeline has test stage, no secrets in YAML/history, security scanning enabled, branch protection on main, pipeline runs green.

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Excuse to Skip | Counter-Argument |
|---|---|
| "Security scanning slows down the pipeline" | A 2-minute scan is cheaper than a 2-week incident response. Shift-left is faster overall. |
| "We'll add security gates later" | Pipelines without gates ship vulnerabilities to production. Add gates from day 1. |
| "It's an internal tool, security doesn't matter" | Internal tools get compromised too. Lateral movement starts from internal services. |
| "I'll just hardcode the secret for now" | "For now" becomes "forever". Use env vars or secret managers from the start. |
| "The test stage isn't needed for this PR" | Every PR can introduce regressions. Test stage is non-negotiable. |
| "OIDC is too complex, I'll use long-lived tokens" | Long-lived tokens are the #1 credential leak vector. OIDC is worth the setup cost. |

## Red Flags

- 🚩 Pipeline has no test stage → incomplete, add test execution
- 🚩 Secrets in YAML files or commit history → rotate immediately
- 🚩 No branch protection on main → anyone can push directly
- 🚩 Security scan disabled "temporarily" → re-enable, temporary = permanent
- 🚩 Pipeline passes but no artifact/report generated → silent failures hidden
- 🚩 Manual deployment without approval gate → add environment protection rules

---

## Verification

Before declaring pipeline/PR work complete, confirm:

- [ ] Pipeline YAML has test stage (not skipped)
- [ ] No secrets in YAML or commit history
- [ ] Security scanning enabled (Trivy/CodeQL/Gitleaks)
- [ ] Branch protection rules configured on main
- [ ] PR linked to work items (if Azure DevOps)
- [ ] Pipeline runs successfully (green check)
