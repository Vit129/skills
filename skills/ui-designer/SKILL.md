# UI Designer

Design and implement distinctive, production-grade interfaces — from aesthetic direction to pixel-perfect code that doesn't look like "AI slop."

## Core Capabilities

| Capability | Count | Use Case |
| ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| **Industry Rules** | 161 | Domain-specific patterns (finance ≠ e-commerce) |
| **UI Styles** | 84 | Visual approaches (minimalism, brutalism, etc.) |
| **Color Palettes** | 192 | Psychology-backed, industry-aligned colors |
| **Font Pairings** | 74 | Google Fonts, accessibility-tested combinations |
| **Chart Types** | 25 | Data visualization for dashboards & analytics |
| **UX Guidelines** | 98 | Detailed interactive patterns |
| **Anti-Patterns** | 24+ | Explicit bans to avoid generic AI aesthetics |
| **Slash Commands** | 17 | Targeted design operations (audit, polish, critique, etc.) |

All counts above are live, searchable via `scripts/search.py` (BM25-ranked over `data/*.csv`) — not a static snapshot. See "Run the Design Search Engine" below.

## Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Output |
| ---- | ------- | ------ |
| **Design** | "ออกแบบ", "design system", "pick colors", "industry rules" | Design spec, tokens, system rules |
| **Implement** | "polish", "make it look better", "build this UI" | Working code with high aesthetic quality |
| **Audit** | "audit", "score this design", "check for anti-patterns", "quality check" — **read-only** | Ranked punch list, grouped by severity — zero edits. See `references/audit-verb.md`. |
| **Redesign** | "redesign this", "this looks templated/generic", "same content, different structure" | Restructured code — same copy/IA, different structural fingerprint. See `references/redesign-verb.md`. |
| **Study** | "study this design", "extract the DNA from [screenshot/URL]", "what makes this design work", a pasted URL/screenshot of an admired design with no build request yet | Diagnosis report; optional portable system on explicit request. See `references/study-verb.md`. |

All modes share the same principles and anti-patterns. `audit` and `study` never edit or write code on their own — they hand off to `Implement`/`Redesign` only after the user confirms.

## Workflow

### Design Mode (spec → tokens → components)

1. **Phase 0** — Detect existing design system
2. **Identify Industry** — SaaS, Finance, Healthcare, E-commerce, Services, Creative, Lifestyle, Emerging Tech
3. **Run Design Search** — `python3 ~/.claude/skills/ui-designer/scripts/search.py "<product type + industry + keywords>" --design-system -p "<Project Name>"` — pulls live-reasoned pattern, style, color, typography, and anti-pattern recommendations (see "Run the Design Search Engine" below)
4. **Context Gathering** — Audience, use cases, brand personality/tone
5. **Aesthetic Direction** — Commit to BOLD tone + differentiation
6. **Run Reasoning Engine** — 4-stage analysis (search → match → generate → validate)
7. **Apply Industry Rules** — Match product type → style → color mood → anti-patterns, using the Step 3 design-search results as the source of truth (supplement with `--domain` searches as needed)
8. **Diversification Check (MANDATORY)** — Read `.ui-designer/log.json` in the target project (if present). The pattern + style pick must differ from the log's last entry on at least one axis (pattern / style / accent hue band) — state the rotation in plain text before locking it in. Skip this check only if a locked `DESIGN.md`/`design-system/<project>/MASTER.md` governs the project (consistency wins there instead — see `references/redesign-verb.md` § Diversification rule — inverted for multi-page). Full protocol: `references/diversification-memory.md`.
9. **Tokens** — Define colors, spacing, typography as CSS variables. Stamp the output's CSS with `/* ui-designer · pattern: <name> · style: <name> · accent: <band> */` per `references/diversification-memory.md`.
10. **Validate** — AI Slop Test + WCAG AA + responsive + dark mode. Append this build to `.ui-designer/log.json` (create the file if absent) so future runs on this project can diversify against it.

### Implement Mode (structure → polish)

1. Structure first (HTML/semantic, no styling)
2. Layout and spacing
3. Typography and color
4. Interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled)
5. Edge case states (empty, loading, error)
6. Motion (purposeful transitions)
7. Responsive adaptation
8. **AI Slop Test** — would someone immediately say "AI made this"? If yes, redo.

## Phase 0: Existing Design System Detection (MANDATORY)

Before designing, check if a design system already exists:

| Found | Action |
| ----- | ------ |
| `DESIGN.md` exists at project root (see `rules/product-design.md`) | Read it first — it's the canonical design language. Align to it, don't regenerate tokens or drift from it. |
| Figma URL exists | Analyze → extract tokens, components → extend, don't rebuild |
| Design tokens file exists (CSS vars, Tailwind config) | Import existing → align, don't override |
| Component library exists (MUI, Ant Design, shadcn/ui) | Document existing → extend with custom tokens |
| Nothing exists | Build new following industry rules + reasoning engine |

**Always ask:** "Do you have an existing design system or Figma file?"

## Run the Design Search Engine

`scripts/search.py` is a standalone BM25 search engine over `data/*.csv` (styles, colors, typography, products, ux-guidelines, charts, icons, motion, react-performance, and 22 stack files under `data/stacks/`) plus `ui-reasoning.csv` for `--design-system` mode. No external dependencies — Python 3.x only.

```bash
# Full design system recommendation (pattern, style, colors, typography, effects, anti-patterns)
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ui-designer/scripts/search.py "<product type + industry + keywords>" --design-system -p "<Project Name>"

# Deep-dive a single dimension
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ui-designer/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --domain <style|color|typography|product|ux|chart|icons|google-fonts|landing>

# Stack-specific guidance (react, nextjs, vue, svelte, astro, swiftui, flutter, jetpack-compose, html-tailwind, shadcn, angular, laravel, and more)
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ui-designer/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --stack <stack>
```

If a search returns 0 results: retry once with broader/different keywords before falling back to the Anti-Patterns/Quick Reference sections below, and say explicitly that the recommendation came from defaults, not a database match — never present a 0-result search as if it returned data.

For the full rule-category priority table and the pre-delivery checklist read `references/design-search/quick-reference.md` and `references/design-search/pro-rules.md`.

## Context Gathering (REQUIRED)

You MUST have confirmed design context before any design work:
- **Target audience**: Who uses this product and in what context?
- **Use cases**: What jobs are they trying to get done?
- **Brand personality/tone**: How should the interface feel?

You cannot infer this by reading the codebase. Code tells you what was built, not who it's for. If `PRODUCT.md` exists at project root, read it for target audience/use cases instead of asking — only ask for what it doesn't cover (e.g. brand tone if `PRODUCT.md` doesn't state it).

## The AI Slop Test

If you showed this interface to someone and said "AI made this," would they believe you immediately? If yes, that's the problem. A distinctive interface should make someone ask "how was this made?"

## Anti-Patterns (Hard Bans)

### Typography
- ❌ Overused fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, DM Sans, Fraunces, Playfair Display, Instrument Sans/Serif, Plus Jakarta Sans, Space Grotesk
- ❌ Monospace as lazy shorthand for "technical" vibes
- ❌ Only one font family for the entire page
- ✅ Reject your first 3 font instincts — they're from training data

### Color
- ❌ Pure black (#000) or pure white (#fff) — always tint neutrals toward brand hue
- ❌ Gray text on colored backgrounds
- ❌ The AI color palette: cyan-on-dark, purple-to-blue gradients, neon accents on dark
- ❌ Default to dark mode with glowing accents
- ❌ Another AI-cluster tell: warm cream (`~#F4F1EA`) + high-contrast serif + terracotta accent — this skill's own "tint neutrals toward brand hue" rule below actually funnels toward this cluster, so watch for it specifically rather than assuming the rule already avoids it [source: Anthropic's official `frontend-design` Claude Code plugin — compared 2026-08-08, not otherwise adopted, see routing.md's SKIP verdict]
- ❌ Heavy `rgba()` / alpha transparency (design smell = incomplete palette)
- ✅ Use OKLCH, not HSL
- ✅ 60-30-10 rule: 60% neutral, 30% secondary, 10% accent
- ✅ Tint neutrals toward brand hue (chroma 0.005-0.01)

### Layout
- ❌ Wrap everything in cards — not everything needs a container
- ❌ Nest cards inside cards
- ❌ Identical card grids (same-sized cards with icon + heading + text, repeated)
- ❌ Center everything — left-aligned with asymmetric layouts feels more designed
- ❌ Numbered markers (01/02/03) as decoration — only use them when order is real information (steps, ranking), not to fake structure
- ✅ Use `gap` instead of margins for sibling spacing
- ✅ 4pt base spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96px

### Motion
- ❌ Bounce or elastic easing — feels dated
- ❌ Animate anything except `transform` and `opacity`
- ✅ Exponential easing (ease-out-quart/quint/expo)
- ✅ 100-150ms feedback, 200-300ms state changes, 300-500ms layout changes
- ✅ Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Visual
- ❌ Glassmorphism everywhere
- ❌ Rounded rectangles with generic drop shadows
- ❌ Modals unless truly no better alternative
- ❌ Side-stripe borders (`border-left` > 1px as accent)
- ❌ Gradient text (`background-clip: text` with gradients)
- ❌ Emojis as icons — use SVG (Heroicons, Lucide)

## Slash Commands (Implement Mode)

| Command | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `/audit` | Read-only quality check — anti-patterns, structural fingerprint, `design-system` drift. Zero edits. See `references/audit-verb.md`. |
| `/critique` | UX evaluation with actionable feedback |
| `/polish` | Final pass — alignment, spacing, consistency, detail |
| `/normalize` | Align with design system standards |
| `/distill` | Strip to essence, remove unnecessary complexity |
| `/clarify` | Improve UX copy, error messages, labels |
| `/optimize` | Performance (loading, rendering, animations, bundle) |
| `/harden` | Resilience (error handling, i18n, overflow, edge cases) |
| `/animate` | Add purposeful motion and micro-interactions |
| `/colorize` | Add strategic color to monochromatic interfaces |
| `/bolder` | Amplify safe/boring designs to be memorable |
| `/quieter` | Tone down overwhelming designs |
| `/delight` | Add moments of joy and personality |
| `/extract` | Pull repeated patterns into reusable components |
| `/adapt` | Responsive adaptation for different devices |
| `/onboard` | Design effective onboarding flows |
| `/teach` | One-time setup: gather design context for project |

### Command Workflows

```text
Quality:     /audit → /normalize → /harden → /polish
Enhancement: /critique → /distill → /colorize → /animate → /polish
New Project: /teach → /critique → /normalize → /animate → /audit → /polish
```

`/audit` is diagnosis-only (see `references/audit-verb.md`) — get the user's confirmation on which findings to act on before continuing into `/normalize`/`/harden`/`/polish` in these chains. `redesign` and `study` (see Modes above) are separate top-level triggers, not slash commands — they operate on an existing page or an external reference rather than polishing the current build.

## Stack Detection

| Stack | Notes |
| ----- | ----- |
| React / Next.js | Tailwind + CSS vars; shadcn/ui if applicable |
| Vue / Nuxt | Same token approach, adapt class syntax |
| Flutter | ThemeData tokens, Material 3 |
| SwiftUI | Color assets + ViewModifier |
| HTML + Tailwind | Default if unspecified |

## Quick Reference

### Typography
- Modular type scale with fluid sizing (`clamp`) for headings
- Cap line length at ~65-75ch
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font

### Spacing
- Vary spacing for hierarchy — not uniform gaps everywhere
- Use whitespace as a design element (cards are overused)

### Design Direction
- Commit to a BOLD aesthetic: brutally minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, brutalist, art deco, soft/pastel, industrial
- What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

## Gotchas

- **Font reflex** — First 3 choices are training data defaults. Reject them.
- **Theme = context** — Dark/light derived from audience, not preference.
- **Alpha = design smell** — Heavy transparency means incomplete palette.
- **Cards are overused** — Spacing and alignment create grouping naturally.
- **Selector specificity can cancel your own spacing rules** — e.g. `.section` and `.cta` both setting padding/margin on the same element can silently cancel each other out; check computed styles, not just the rule you just wrote.

## Conventions

- Aesthetic direction first → tokens → components (always in this order)
- Semantic color names (`--color-primary` not `--blue`)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- No emojis as icons — use SVG (Heroicons, Lucide)

---

## Red Flags

- 🚩 Uses Inter, Roboto, DM Sans, or any banned font → Reject and find distinctive alternative
- 🚩 No context gathering happened → Stop and ask user for audience, use cases, brand tone
- 🚩 Passes "AI Slop Test" negatively → Lacks bold direction; commit to specific tone
- 🚩 Heavy `rgba()` / alpha transparency → Incomplete palette; define explicit tokens
- 🚩 No industry identification → Reasoning engine skipped; identify sector first
- 🚩 Implementation starts with colors before HTML structure → Wrong order
- 🚩 Pure #000/#fff in tokens → Always tint neutrals toward brand hue

---

## Verification

Before declaring complete, confirm:

- [ ] Context gathered (audience, use cases, brand tone)
- [ ] Industry identified (SaaS/Finance/Healthcare/etc.)
- [ ] Existing design system checked (Phase 0)
- [ ] Passes AI Slop Test — doesn't look generically AI-generated
- [ ] No banned fonts used
- [ ] Color tokens defined (no pure #000/#fff, no rgba overuse)
- [ ] WCAG AA contrast ratios validated
- [ ] Implementation order followed (if code was written)
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` respected
- [ ] Pre-delivery checklist passed (responsive, touch targets, dark mode, focus states)
- [ ] Tokens defined BEFORE component design
- [ ] Diversification check run against `.ui-designer/log.json` and the pick stamped/logged (Design Mode only — skip on a locked `DESIGN.md`/`MASTER.md` project)
